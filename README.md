  A combination of Clean architecture, Android architecture components, and MVVM has been used as the design pattern; koin was implemented for the injection of dependencies in the modules of Activities, fragments, view models and API configurations with retrofit; finally, the application was written 100% in kotlin because it is currently the official language for Android.
